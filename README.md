# GA-tsp--Cycling-route-problem
The optimal path problem in the graph is realized by GA algorithm. Realistic practical application, by selecting 20 natural landscape latitude and longitude points in Sanya suitable for cycling, and using the algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution after a set number of iterations. Features: calculating the distance between two points by latitude and longitude (applicable to the earth's surface, but treating the earth as a sphere for solution), and introducing an exact calculation package to further reduce the error value.
